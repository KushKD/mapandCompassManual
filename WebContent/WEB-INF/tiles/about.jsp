				Map ‘n’ Compass is the brainchild of two traveller friends, the very foundation of whose friendship is based on lust, not in the primal meaning of the word, but an irresistible longing for the road, for summits and valleys, for adventure – Wanderlust. With one of the founders of this venture being a student in the field of tourism itself, and the other finding it hard to sit through anymore lectures due to his frequent gateways, Map ‘n’ Compass has in it’s very roots, a thirst for exploration and an appetite for memorable excursions. If ideas could be personified, Map ‘n’ Compass would have been a Bedouin, or a voyager; someone who lives to move and travel, beyond inhibition and routine. We don’t deal in packages or trips. We deal in experiences. Come and see!
